## 1️⃣ Project Construction

This project uses HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript to make the individual features of the game work. The above three programming languages were used in conjunction with the Bootstrap Framework to ensure the project itself is as responsive as possible for use amongst the current everyday screen device sizes such as, Mobile, Tablet and Laptop.
